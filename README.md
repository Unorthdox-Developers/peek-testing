#### Coding Conventions

1. **Document your code**
    :  In the ideal world a piece of code should be self-explanatory about what it does, but that's not always the case. So just-in-case, please use commenting techniqies or use IDE tools to document your code e.g.
  
    `` /** This is your comment  **/ ``
       
    `` # This is your comment ``
  
2. **Indentation**
     :  Proper space are important to increase code readability. For making the code clear, dev's should utilize white spaces properly. 
        
      Some of the conventions are as follows :
      - There must be a space after giving a comma between two function arguments
      - Proper Indentation should be there at the beginning and at the end of each block in the program
      - All braces should start from a new line and the code following the end of braces also start from a new line
      - Each nested block should be properly indented and spaced
    
3. **Naming Conventions**
    :  In the ideal world a piece of code should be self-explanatory about what it does, but that's not always the case.
    
4. **DRY Principle**
    :  In the ideal world a piece of code should be self-explanatory about what it does, but that's not always the case.
    
5. **Code readibility**
    :  In the ideal world a piece of code should be self-explanatory about what it does, but that's not always the case.

#### Testing Pyramid

 The Testing Pryamid is a framework that helps the engineering team create high-quality software. It helps the team reduce time in identifying breaking changes and be more confident in introducing code changes.

Essentially the testing pyramid lays out the testing approach in a pryamid form. The goal of this concept is to provide quick feedback to the team about issues/bugs etc.

   **Operation level**

  - Level 1 : Unit tests
  - Level 2 : Integration tests/Contract tests
  - Level 3 : End-to-End test
  - Level 4 : Manual Exploratory Testing
